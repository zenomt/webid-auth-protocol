WebID HTTP Authorization Protocol
=================================

Introduction
------------
This memo proposes a protocol to obtain HTTP bearer-type authorization tokens
that can establish that the agent requesting a resource is acting on behalf
of a [WebID][] URI (WebID). The protocol includes methods for both [WebID-OIDC][]
and [WebID-TLS][] authenticated identities, including a means to authenticate
WebID-OIDC identities using [Self-Issued OpenID Providers][OIDC-SelfIssued].

This protocol is intended to be used by [Solid][] applications, in particular
browser-based applications, but is generally applicable to any HTTP access
scenario where the accessing agent is to be identified as acting on direct
behalf of (and access to be granted or denied) a WebID and optionally the
agent's application identifier.

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL
NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**",
"**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 \[[RFC2119][]\] \[[RFC8174][]\] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The Problems
------------

### WebID-OIDC

When demonstrating control of a WebID with WebID-OIDC, a Relying Party (RP)
obtains an Identity Token (`id_token`) as a direct client of the OIDC Provider
(OP).  This is the *first party* scenario, for example where the user logs
directly in to her POD or to an online application. In this scenario, the
user, when attempting to log in or to access a restricted resource on the RP,
is directed by the RP to select her OP, log in there, and the OP will then
return a signed `id_token` to the RP, which can be verified and the user
considered logged in (for example, by the RP setting a cookie in the user's
browser).

In what is expected to eventually be the common case, the RP will be an
in-browser Javascript-based application, and this application will attempt
to access resources on other servers (the user's or other PODs, other web
servers, etc) on behalf of the user.

Today, the Solid reference implementation addresses this case by using an
ad hoc *Proof of Possession Token (POPToken)* directly as an HTTP Authorization
[Bearer token][RFC6750]. Here, a *POPToken* is a [JWT][RFC7519] containing
an OIDC `id_token` (which itself is independently validated and which bears
a [Proof of Possession key][RFC7800] as the `cnf` claim), an `aud`ience binding
it to the origin of the resource being accessed, and an `iss`uer being the
client to which the `id_token` was issued. The *POPToken* is signed with the
private key associated with the `cnf` claim.

There are a number of issues with this solution:

  - There is no notion of an independent "session" at the resource server:
    * An access grant can't be for longer or shorter than the token's validity
      period;
    * There's no way to "log out" or revoke access for that token without
      blacklisting it until it expires;
    * There's no opportunity to directly challenge the agent to sign an
      arbitrary value of the resource server's choice in order to prove current
      control of the proof-of-possession key;

  - In a traditional OAuth scenario, the resource server and the authorization
    server are coupled, and access tokens can be structured for efficient
    validation and use by the resource server; here the resource server must
    accept the *POPToken* format when processing all requests even if that isn't
    efficient or ideal;

  - (Related) in a traditional OAuth scenario where the resource server and
    the authorization server are coupled, all parties (authorization server +
    resource server, and app/agent) are involved when issuing an access
    token.  With this solution, the resource server can only passively receive
    and validate an access token with no opportunity to influence its issuance;

  - The same access token is usable for every resource at an origin, whether
    or not that is appropriate to the security policies for every
    [protection space][] at that origin. A new access token could be issued
    for each request, bound specifically to the URI being accessed, but this
    would incur a large computational cost at the agent and resource server
    (see next item);

  - A *POPToken* is expensive to validate on every request. Validation decisions
    could be cached, keyed on the entire token, but this is only practical if
    the same token is used on every request;

  - *POPTokens* can be big, which can be a lot of overhead for every request.
    Even with HTTP/2+ header compression, the token is still a logical part
    of every request's header set, which affects downstream request processing
    in common web application server architectures.

At this time, browser-based applications can only be identified to resource
servers via the `Origin` HTTP header (except in the special case where the
OP and the resource server are coupled).  When using bearer tokens, a non-browser
component of a rogue application can forge an arbitrary `Origin` header;
therefore, using the `Origin` header for application identity is not acceptable
in this circumstance.


### WebID-TLS

Notwithstanding the logistical problem of securely loading a WebID-TLS
certificate into multiple browsers, and the browser user experience problems
of managing certificates, and granting (and especially revoking, changing,
or logging out) the use of a certificate to communicate with a particular
origin server in today's web browsers, TLS itself and commonly deployed web
servers provide no way to conditionally use a client-side certificate for
only some requests to the same origin. Whether to send a client certificate
to the server is determined during the initial TLS handshake (after a target
hostname is sent by the client but before the target path is sent), and is
thereafter fixed for the duration of the TLS connection. While this can be
renegotiated at a later time in TLS 1.2, renegotiation is currently
[not allowed in HTTP/2][http2-norenego], and there is no standard way for an
application web server to indicate to an upstream TLS reverse proxy (such as
[nginx][]) to renegotiate or restart the session (with just that client)
requesting a client certificate.

Commonly deployed web servers (such as nginx) can be configured to request a
client certificate for specific named (virtual) hosts. The client certificate
will be requested on all connections to that host. If this host/origin is the
host for the desired resources, then either a client certificate will be
required to be sent for all requests (even ones that shouldn't require
authorization), or, if the initial certificate request is denied by the user,
there will be no opportunity later to demand the client certificate for only
the restricted resources.

A possible workaround is to use a server at a subdomain configured to require
a client certificate. The user can be directed to follow a link to a page on
this subdomain host, and if the certificate is presented, verified, and
properly linked to a WebID, this page can set a browser cookie in the
superdomain. The user can be redirected back to the original domain, and new
requests will include the cookie. This scenario shares first-party cookie-based
issues similar to WebID-OIDC first-party logins, which might not be desirable
for application-based access. These issues include Cross-Site Request Forgery
attacks, among others, that might grant an attacker or even another legitimate
application more privilege than is desirable. Additionally, if cookies aren't
allowed for cross-origin requests by the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
header, the application might not be able to access a restricted resource
even after following the above workaround.

The Protocol
------------
This memo proposes a solution to the above issues. Most importantly, it
provides a mechanism for the resource server to directly challenge the agent
to prove control of a POP Key, and for a resource server (or its authorization
designate) to issue access tokens that are tailored for its unique operational
and architectural constraints.

*WebID HTTP Authorization Protocol* comprises the following components:

  - New parameters to the `WWW-Authenticate` response header for
    the `Bearer` method, and supplemental semantics;

  - An API endpoint for exchanging a proof of possession for an access token;

  - Supplemental methods for verifying the `id_token`;

  - A supplemental behavior for WebID-OIDC OPs to include the `redirect_uri`
    in the `aud`ience of the `id_token` in certain circumstances, to be used
    as an application identity (with caveats);

  - An API endpoint for obtaining an access token when using WebID-TLS;

  - A token delivery mode with which to establish an application identity
    when using WebID-TLS (with caveats);

  - An operational semantics.

Syntax
------

### `WWW-Authenticate` Parameters for `Bearer` Method

A resource server, to challenge an unauthorized request using this protocol,
will employ a combination of the following parameters in a `WWW-Authenticate`
header returned in an HTTP `401` response to a request:

  - `scope`: For challenges according to this protocol, the `scope` parameter
    **SHALL** include at least the `webid` scope;

  - `nonce`: This parameter conveys an opaque challenge string to be used as
    described below;

  - `token_pop_endpoint`: The URI of the WebID-OIDC POP Token exchange endpoint,
    if available; `scope` **MUST** also include `openid`;

  - `client_cert_endpoint`: The URI of the WebID-TLS token endpoint, if available;

  - `error`: If present, the request had a problem other than not presenting
    an access credential. The following reason codes are defined:
    * `invalid_token`: A `Bearer` token was presented, but it was expired,
      revoked, or otherwise not recognized as valid.
    * `proof_required`: A `Bearer` token requiring proof-of-possession
      of a secret key (but otherwise valid) was presented. It should be
      exchanged for a new token according to this protocol.

If a request is made for a resource within a protection space and that request
includes an `Authorization` header with an invalid `Bearer` token, the resource
server **SHOULD** reply with an HTTP `401` response and `WWW-Authenticate`
header as above, even if the request otherwise doesn't require `Authorization`.
This is to allow an agent to obtain a fresh access token proactively (for
example, before the current token expires, to avoid delaying a real request
by the user).

### Include `redirect_uri` in OIDC `id_token`

In order to identify an application when the `Origin` header is not trustable
(specifically, when presenting a bearer token), a WebID-OIDC OP **SHOULD**
include in the list of `aud`iences the `redirect_uri` to which the `id_token`
or `code` was sent, if and only if the `webid` scope (or other scopes whose
semantics define this behavior) was requested by the client.

A client conforming to this protocol **SHOULD** request the `webid` additional
scope from the OP in order to allow third party servers to make access control
decisions based on the application identifier.

#### Discussion

The `redirect_uri` used in OAuth2/OIDC flows can be used as an application
identifier.  Some RPs might consider an unrecognized `aud` entry as an untrusted
audience and reject the `id_token`. Therefore the `redirect_uri` will not be
included unless the client has signaled a desire for its presence with an
appropriate scope.

### Include `cnf` (Confirmation Key) Claim in OIDC `id_token`

The WebID-OIDC portion of this protocol **REQUIRES** that the `id_token`
contain a [`cnf`][RFC7800] claim comprising an asymmetric public key as a
JWK. The method by which an agent requests the addition of a `cnf` claim in
an `id_token` is not yet standardized in OIDC, but will probably be similar
to the method described in [draft-ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution][pop-key-dist].
The Solid reference implementation uses a different ad-hoc method.

TBD interop constraints (RS256?).

### Proof of Possession Token

This section specifies a Proof of Possession Token format for use in this
protocol. This format is a modest modification of the bespoke *POPTokens*
currently in use in the Solid reference implementation, as determined from
source code inspection.

The Proof of Possession Token (*proof-token*) is a [JWT][RFC7519], signed by
the `id_token`'s confirmation key, and comprising the following claims:

  - `token`: **REQUIRED**: A WebID-OIDC `id_token` containing a `cnf` claim
    as described above, and otherwise valid to identify the user requesting
    access;

  - `aud`: **REQUIRED**: The [absolute URI][], including scheme, authority
    (host and optional port), path, and query, but not including fragment
    identifier, corresponding to the original request that resulted in the
    HTTP `401` response; this claim **MUST NOT** include a fragment identifier;
    if this claim is an array, it **MUST** have exactly one element;

  - `nonce`: **REQUIRED**: The nonce from the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge;

  - `iss`: **REQUIRED** (for WebID-OIDC): The issuer of this *proof-token*,
    which **MUST** be present in the `token`'s `aud` claim; the value of
    this claim is used as the application identifier, and therefore **SHOULD**
    be the `redirect_uri` to which the `id_token` or `code` was sent (see
    above);

  - `jti`: **RECOMMENDED**: Use of this claim is recommended so that the agent
    can salt the token's signature; the verifier can ignore this claim, if
    present;

  - `app_authorizations`: **OPTIONAL** (for WebID-OIDC): If present, this is
    one (string) or more (array of strings) [App Authorization][app-auth] URIs;

  - `exp`: **OPTIONAL**: If present, this claim **MUST NOT** be after the
    expiration time of the `token` (if it has one), and **MUST NOT** be before
    the current time on the verifier; ordinarily the validity of the `nonce`
    is sufficient to establish not-before and not-after constraints on the
    proof, so this claim isn't usually necessary (and clocks on end-user
    devices, where *proof-tokens* are likely to be generated, are often
    inaccurate).  The server **MAY** take the expiration periods of the
    *proof-token* and the `token` into account when determining the expiration
    period of the access token it issues, but it is not required to do so and
    is free to issue access tokens with any expiration period.

Unrecognized claims **SHOULD** be ignored.

### `token_pop_endpoint` API Parameters

In order to avoid leaving sensitive information in web server logs, the agent
**SHOULD** access this API by HTTP `POST` method, but `GET` **MUST** also be
supported by the server. The API takes the following parameters, either in
the request body as Content-Type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format
for `POST`, or as URI query parameters for `GET`:

  - `proof_token`: **REQUIRED**: A *proof-token* as described above;

  - `redirect_uri`: **OPTIONAL**: If present, the response will be made in the
    form of an HTTP `302` redirect to this URI, otherwise the response will
    be made in the response body as a JSON object; use of this mode is
    **NOT RECOMMENDED**;

  - `state`: **OPTIONAL**: If present, opaque application state to be echoed
    back in a redirect response.

A successful response comprises the following parameters:

  - `access_token`: An opaque string comprising a `Bearer` access token that
    can be used for requests in the same [protection space][] as the original
    request;

  - `expires_in`: A numeric number of seconds from the `Date` of this response
    at which the `access_token` will no longer be valid;

  - `state`: A string, the `state` from the request, echoed unmodified. Only
    included in the response if the request included a `state`.

  - `token_type`: A case-insensitive string identifying the kind of token
    returned in this response. For this protocol the value **MUST** be `Bearer`.

Unrecognized parameters **SHOULD** be ignored.

TBD: error response.

If no `redirect_uri` was included, the response body is a JSON object in
Content-Type `application/json` format whose keys are the response parameters.

If a `redirect_uri` was included, the response is an HTTP `302` redirect with
the `Location` being the `redirect_uri`, followed by a fragment indicator
`#`, and the response parameters in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` form.
Only the fragment form is allowed to avoid the `access_token` accidentally
appearing in web server logs.

Note: A `redirect_uri` parameter, if included in the request, is only for
delivering an access token to the application. It **MUST NOT** be construed
as an application identifier in the WebID-OIDC mode, even if the `id_token`
doesn't include a recognizable application identifier.

### `client_cert_endpoint` API Parameters

The `client_cert_endpoint` API **MUST** support HTTP `POST` and `GET` methods.
The API takes the following parameters, either in the request body as Content-Type
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format for `POST`, or as URI query
parameters for `GET`:

  - `nonce`: **REQUIRED**: The nonce from the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge;

  - `uri`: **REQUIRED**: The [absolute URI][], including scheme, authority
    (host and optional port), path, and query, but not including fragment
    identifier, corresponding to the original request that resulted in the
    HTTP `401` response. This parameter **MUST NOT** include a fragment
    identifier;

  - `app_authorizations`: **OPTIONAL** (for WebID-TLS): Zero or more
    [App Authorization][app-auth] URIs (may occur more than once);

  - `redirect_uri`: **OPTIONAL**: If present, the response will be made in the
    form of an HTTP `302` redirect to this URI; otherwise the response will
    be made in the response body as a JSON object; use of this mode is
    **NOT RECOMMENDED**;

  - `state`: **OPTIONAL**: If present, opaque application state to be echoed
    back in a redirect response. Only useful if a `redirect_uri` is specified.

A TLS client certificate is **REQUIRED** when communicating with this API
endpoint. That means the API endpoint will probably be at a different origin
from the original URI.

A successful response is made in the same manner as one for the `token_pop_endpoint`.

Because the agent accessing this endpoint is in direct control of the TLS
client certificate's private key, the `redirect_uri`, if used, can be used
to establish an application identifier with the same assurance as in an OAuth2
workflow.

TBD: error response.

Note: If a `redirect_uri` is not included in the request, then the `Origin`
header from the request to the `client_cert_endpoint` provides the most granular
application identifier available for access control decisions.

Operation
---------
An agent (for example, an in-browser application working on behalf of a user)
attempts an HTTP request to a resource server for an access-restricted URI
without presenting any special credentials.

	GET /some/restricted/resource HTTP/2
	Host: www.example.com
	Origin: https://other.example.com

The resource server does not allow this request without authorization.  It
generates an unguessable, opaque nonce that the server **SHOULD** be able to
later recognize as having generated. The server responds with an HTTP `401`
Unauthorized message, and includes the [protection space][] (`realm`), this
nonce, the appropriate scopes, and the `token_pop_endpoint` and `client_cert_endpoint`
URIs as appropriate, in the `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Bearer` method.
The server **MAY** also include an HTML response body, for example to allow
the user to perform a first-party login using another method, such as by
selecting her OIDC Provider, for cases where the resource was navigated to
directly in the browser.

	HTTP/2 401 Unauthorized
	WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="/auth/",
	    scope="openid webid",
	    nonce="j16C4SOLQWFor3VYUtZWnrUr5AG5uwDF7q9RFsDk",
	    token_pop_endpoint="/auth/webid-pop",
	    client_cert_endpoint="https://webid-tls.example.com/auth/webid-tls"
	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://other.example.com
	Access-Control-Expose-Headers: WWW-Authenticate
	Date: Mon,  6 May 2019 01:48:48 GMT
	Content-type: text/html
	
	<html>Human first-party login page...</html>

The agent recognizes the response as compatible with this protocol by recognizing
the method as `Bearer`, scope `webid`, and the presence of the `nonce` and
either of the `token_pop_endpoint` or `client_cert_endpoint` parameters.

### WebID-OIDC Proof of Possession Operation

The agent recognizes availability of the WebID-OIDC POP method (including
scopes `webid` and `openid` and the `token_pop_endpoint`) and determines to
use this method.

It is assumed that the agent already possesses a valid and current `id_token`
from the user's OP (including a `cnf` confirmation claim), and the private
key material corresponding to the public key in the `cnf` claim.

The agent creates a new *proof-token* as described above, setting its `aud`
claim to the absolute URI of the original request, the `nonce` claim to the
`nonce` parameter from the `WWW-Authenticate` response header, the `token`
claim to its `id_token` from above, including any [App Authorizations][app-auth],
and signing it with the private keying material associated with the `cnf`
claim of its `id_token`.

The agent sends a request to the `token_pop_endpoint` URI, including the
*proof-token*, and if using the redirect response mode, a `redirect_uri` and
a `state`.

	POST /auth/webid-pop HTTP/2
	Host: www.example.com
	Origin: https://other.example.com
	Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
	proof_token=ey...(rest of token omitted)

The endpoint verifies this request:

  1. Parses the `proof_token`, extracting its claims;

  2. Parses the `token` claim of the `proof_token`, extracting its claims
     including the WebID it identifies;

  3. Verifies the `proof_token`'s `iss` (the `iss` **MUST** be present in the
     `token`'s `aud` claim);

  4. Verifies the signature of the `proof_token` with the `cnf` claim of the
    `token`;

  5. Verifies the `proof_token`'s `aud` is an absolute URI for a resource in
     the protection space for which this endpoint is responsible;

  6. Verifies the `proof_token`'s `nonce` (for example, confirming it was
     really issued by this system, not too far in the past, hasn't been
     redeemed yet, and was issued for a request for the `aud` claim);

  7. Loads and parses the WebID document to extract the OIDC Issuer (if
     listed) and public keys (if listed) for the WebID;

  8. Verifies the `token` signature. If the `token` is
     [self issued][OIDC-SelfIssued], the public key **MUST** be listed in the
     WebID.  Otherwise, [OIDC Discovery][], based on the `token`'s `iss`
     claim, is used to find the public key. The `iss` **MUST** be an authorized
     OIDC issuer.

  9. Determines the application identifier, which is the `iss` of the
     `proof_token`. The `iss` of the `proof_token` **MUST** be present
     in the `aud` claim of the `id_token`.

 10. Determines [App Authorizations][app-auth] from the `proof_token`'s
     `app_authorizations`, if any, that correspond to the application identifier.

If the request is verified, the endpoint issues an `access_token` valid for
this protection space and for a limited time. The `access_token` **SHOULD**
be translatable by a server for this protection space into at least the WebID,
the application identifier, and app authorizations, by whatever means is
convenient (for example, by lookup in a database, or by direct encoding in
the access token).

	HTTP/2 200
	Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Cache-control: no-cache, no-store
	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://other.example.com
	Date: Mon,  6 May 2019 01:48:50 GMT
	
	{
		"access_token": "gZDES1DqHf1i3zydSqfnsgGhkMgc4gcbpnCHSCcQ",
		"expires_in": 1800,
		"token_type": "Bearer"
	}

The agent can now use this `access_token` as a bearer token in the `Authorization`
header for requests in the same protection space.

	GET /some/restricted/resource HTTP/2
	Host: www.example.com
	Origin: https://other.example.com
	Authorization: Bearer gZDES1DqHf1i3zydSqfnsgGhkMgc4gcbpnCHSCcQ

The server verifies and translates the bearer token into a WebID, application
identifier, and app authorizations,and can use those data and any others at
its disposal to make a determination whether to grant access to the requested
resource.

	    Figure 1: Accessing a Restricted Resource With WebID-OIDC POP Method

### WebID-TLS Operation

The agent recognizes availability of the WebID-TLS mode (including presence
of the `webid` `scope` and the `client_cert_endpoint`) and determines to use
this method.

The agent sends, using its WebID-TLS client certificate, to the `client_cert_endpoint`
URI. The origin for this URI will probably be different from the original
request URI, in order for the server to request a client certificate in the
TLS handshake.  It is assumed that the original server that responded with
`401` and this API server are coupled such that this API server is able to
verify the `nonce` and return a bearer token that is meaningful in the original
server's protection space.

	POST /auth/webid-tls HTTP/2
	Host: webid-tls.example.com
	Origin: https://other.example.com
	Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
	nonce=j16C4SOLQWFor3VYUtZWnrUr5AG5uwDF7q9RFsDk
	&uri=https://www.example.com/some/restricted/resource
	&app_authorizations=https://mike.example/wac/app-auth/b6d88441302c07700743b8d793ae2a8a.ttl#it

The server verifies the request:

  1. Verifies the `nonce` (for example, confirming that it was really issued
     by the original server, not too far in the past, and hasn't been redeemed
     yet);

  2. Verifies that `uri` is an absolute URI and is in the protection space
     for which this endpoint is responsible, and if possible that `uri`
     corresponds with the `nonce`;

  3. Verifies, [in the normal way][WebID-TLS], the WebID by extracting
     the public key from the client certificate used in the TLS connection,
     loading the WebID document according to the SubjectAlternativeName field,
     and looking for a matching public key in the WebID;

  4. Determines the application identifier, which is the `redirect_uri` of
     the request if it was given, or the `Origin` header of this request if
     present, or Unknown;

  5. Determines [App Authorizations][app-auth] from the `app_authorizations`,
     if any, that correspond to the application identifier.

If the request is verified, the server issues an `access_token` valid for the
original server's protection space and for a limited time. The `access_token`
**SHOULD** be translatable by any server for the orginal protection space
into at least the WebID, application identifier, and app authorizations.

	HTTP/2 200
	Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Cache-control: no-cache, no-store
	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://other.example.com
	Date: Mon,  6 May 2019 01:48:50 GMT
	
	{
		"access_token": "gZDES1DqHf1i3zydSqfnsgGhkMgc4gcbpnCHSCcQ",
		"expires_in": 1800,
		"token_type": "Bearer"
	}

The agent can now use this `access_token` as a bearer token in the `Authorization`
header for requests in the same protection space at the original request URI's
origin.

	GET /some/restricted/resource HTTP/2
	Host: www.example.com
	Origin: https://other.example.com
	Authorization: Bearer gZDES1DqHf1i3zydSqfnsgGhkMgc4gcbpnCHSCcQ

Security Considerations
-----------------------
Having a bearer token issued from this protocol doesn't guarantee access to
the requested resource. Access control facilities in the resource server can
use the identity associated with the bearer token and other considerations
to determine access rights.

### Redirect Workflow Considerations

Care **SHOULD** be taken so that the `Location` header in response to the
`client_cert_endpoint` is not exposed to browser scripts in redirect-type
responses. The redirect-type response flow in a browser application is intended
to only allow a browser application to obtain the returned parameters if the
redirect was actually followed, indicating the `redirect_uri` is part of the
application. If the `Location` header can be read directly by the browser
script from an `XMLHTTPRequest` or `Fetch` response without the redirect being
followed, any browser application can impersonate any other browser application
to the `client_cert_endpoint`.

The `redirect_uri` (either as part of this API flow or extracted from an
`id_token`) is not truly secure, but is only a strong indicator that the
`redirect_uri` was used in a browser-based application. Non-browser applications
(such as native applications, servers, robots, or any other agent) are not
subject to the [Same-Origin policy][same-origin] or
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)][CORS] restrictions, and have full
access to all request and response headers of all HTTP transactions (including
ones to OIDC Providers), and therefore can impersonate any `redirect_uri`
(and therefore any application identifier) or origin, whether associated with
the application or not.

The presence and use of a `redirect_uri` with the above APIs (either directly
in the WebID-TLS mode or extracted from an `id_token` in the WebID-OIDC mode)
indicates only that the authenticated WebID asserts that the URI identifies
an application she has consented to use. It does not guarantee that any
particular URI was actually followed. The WebID making this assertion is the
only party that should assign a trustability to any such URI.  This distinction
**SHOULD** be considered when making access control decisions.

### Nonce Considerations

Nonces issued by servers in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header **SHOULD**
have the following properties:

  - Be cryptographically strong, of sufficient length, and unguessable;

  - Be recognizable when returned as having been issued for this protection
    space (for example, by recording in a database, or including a cryptographic
    signature);

  - Be valid for a limited (short) time;

  - Be redeemable at most once;

  - Be coupled to the original request URI in a recognizable way;

### Man-In-The-Middle Considerations

Consider a server "Real" with a desirable, but restricted, resource; and a
server "Rogue" that wants to access the resource on Real. Consider a user
"User" who has permission to access the resource at Real, and who might come
to access Rogue for some reason (clickbait, or perhaps Rogue provides some
seemingly useful service as well).

#### Man-In-The-Middle With WebID-TLS

Rogue could attempt to access a restricted resource on Real and obtain a
`nonce` and `client_cert_endpoint` URI. Rogue could then challenge User's access
request for a Rogue resource with the same `nonce` *and* the same
`client_cert_endpoint` from Real.

User would contact Real's `client_cert_endpoint` and obtain an `access_token`.
If the call to Real didn't include the original request URI, and instead
relied only on the `nonce` (or metadata associated with it), User could give
this token to Rogue which would then be able to use it to access Real.

To ensure Real and User are talking about the same resource, the `client_cert_endpoint`
request includes the `uri` in an analogous form to the `token_pop_endpoint` flow.

#### Man-In-The-Middle With HTTP Redirects

User **SHOULD** take care to contain disclosure of the `access_token` to the
protection space for which it was issued.  The HTTP `WWW-Authenticate` `realm`
parameter doesn't describe the extent of the protection space at the origin
in a standard way.  Therefore, the extent of the protection space might not
be known ahead of time, so at the very least, User **MUST NOT** disclose the
`access_token` beyond the origin of the original request URI parameter used
to obtain it.

Rogue could use an HTTP `3XX` response to redirect User to access a protected
resource at Real. Depending on the APIs Real's agent uses, the redirect might
be followed automatically or the `Location` might be exposed to the agent to
be followed under manual control.

If the redirect is followed automatically, the URI will be for Rogue, and Real
will reject the token request.

If the redirect is followed manually by User, the URI will be for Real, and
User will receive an `access_token`. In this case, User knows the protection
space is for Real and not Rogue (assuming they have different origins, see
below). User **MUST** notice that Real's protection space is different than
Rogue's, and **MUST NOT** send the token to Rogue for future requests.

If Real and Rogue have the same origin, Rogue can obtain an `access_token`
for Real as User, as detailed above. However, if Real and Rogue have the same
origin, [you are having a bad problem][same-origin] and
[you will not go to space today][up goer five].

### Application Impersonation With WebID-OIDC and Proof Tokens

If User consents to use a Rogue application comprising a rogue user interface
and a rogue server component, Rogue can obtain a signed `id_token` that
includes a `cnf` claim to which Rogue has control of the private keying
material.  The private keying material for the `cnf` could already be on the
server or could be transferred to the server by the user interface.

The server is then free to create *proof-tokens* for any resource, and set
any request headers (including `Origin`) and inspect any response bodies or
headers (including `Location`), and the server is under no obligation to
follow any redirect or interpret any pages or scripts at the destination.

Therefore, the `redirect_uri` parameter and the `Origin` (or any other) request
header **MUST NOT** be used as an application identifier in the `token_pop_endpoint`,
since they can be forged by Rogue with no additional input or consent by User.
Since User trusts her OpenID Provider, a `redirect_uri` extracted from the
signed `id_token`'s `aud` is the only reliable application identifier, and
then only according to User's assertion.

### Unknown/Unidentified Application Considerations

When accessing resources as part of a first-party login session (authorized,
for example, with a cookie), the lack of an `Origin` header (or the `Origin`
denoting the resource server's own origin) is typically construed to mean
that the user is accessing the resources directly with the native, first-party
application.

The nature of a bearer token is that any agent presenting it is presumed to
be the entity to which it was issued. A Rogue application can send an
`access_token` to a server, which is not constrained on any HTTP headers it
can send or omit (including `Origin`).

Therefore, an application presenting a bearer `access_token` that resolves
to an unknown or unidentified application **MUST** be considered to be distinct
from the "no/same `Origin` in a first-party session" application assumption
case. A resource server **SHOULD** ignore the `Origin` header, for purposes
of access control or application identification, when a bearer `access_token`
is presented for authorization, since the agent bearing the token could have
set that header to any value.
